1) Data set

This contains cancer data set from sklearn.
This data set has 569 observations and 30 variables excluding the class variable. This data is an imbalanced
data set, that means the classes ‘0’ and ‘1’ are not represented equally.
First,Try to balance data set using methods you have learned in class if possible.explain about ways you have
used in your report and test them.
if it is not possible or is not efficient,explain why. reload new data set(if it ha changed).
after loading,return target and values of the dataset as x,y.(you can do it via "breast-cancer.data" and "breastcancer.
target" commands).
Then you need to scale data to bring all features in 0-1 range. after that, split data into "train" and "test".

2) Building Model
You should write all your model in a class named "perceptron". then for each parts below, you can write
functions in this class.
First,initialize the weights vector w and threshold b to None.
Write a function that takes input values x as an argument and perform the weighted aggregation of inputs
(dot product between w.x) and returns the value 1 if the aggregation is greater than the threshold b else 0
Write a function that takes input values x as an argument and for every observation present in x, calculates
the predicted outcome and returns a list of predictions.
Write a function to learn the best possible weight vector w and threshold value b for the given data.It takes
’input data(x,y)’, ’learning rate’ and ’number of epochs’ as arguments.

3) Run and Evaluate
initialize the main class fit the model to the train data.
evaluate the model performance on the test data via calculating the testing accuracy.


4) Further optimization
Take random weights in your model and test the result.
Vary the train-test size split and see if accuracy changes.
Choose larger ’epochs sizes’, ’learning rates’. test on the model and visualize the change in accuracy.
